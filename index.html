						Hi! I’m Allegra, I’m 19 years old, and I’m Italian. I was born in Rome, but I lived basically all my life in Milan until last September when I moved here to France to continue my studies. I love to travel and especially to do it by listening to music. I also really enjoy watching movies and tv shows. I have an older sister, Chiara, who lives in Rome, and a dog, Mia, in Milan with the rest of my family.  I’m a curious person, and I love a good challenge!</p>

				<h2><strong>Travelling</strong></h2>
					<p>
						I have always loved to <strong>travel</strong>, seeing new places, exploring and getting to know different cultures. I still have so many places I want to go to and I can’t wait to visit them all.

				<h2><strong>Music</strong></h2>
					<p> I have always been obsessed with <strong>music</strong>. I took piano lessons when I was younger and then during quarantine I taught myself how to play guitar as a way to defeat boredom.</p>
